# Advection Corrected Correlation Image Velocimetry (ACCIV)

ACCIV is a software that can be used to construct velocity fields from
time-separated image data, with a particular focus on planetary-science
applications. ACCIV is described in
[Asay-Davis et al. (2009)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2009.05.001).
